<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Computer Science student at Lev Academic Center (JCT), 
  where I also serve as a Student Ambassador for the program. 
  In this role, I use my programming and communication skills to 
  represent and promote the program to prospective students, parents,
  and educators, creating engaging and informative presentations, webinars,
  and social media posts. I also mentor and assist new and current students, 
  helping them with academic and personal issues, and connecting them with 
  relevant resources and opportunities.</p>

  <p>Besides my studies and ambassador role, I have gained valuable
    teaching and logistics experience through two recent internships.
    In August and September 2023, I taught Torah and Technology 
    classes at The Jewish Leadership Academy, where I prepared and 
    delivered lessons on topics such as cultured meat and artificial 
    intelligence in Jewish law. From February to August 2023, I 
    supported the coordination and organization of internships, 
    travel, and education for 120 teens at NCSY Next Step, a summer 
    program in Israel. Through these internships, I enhanced my 
    leadership, problem-solving, and organizational skills, as well 
    as my passion for learning and sharing knowledge.</p>
